description: The in-app file browser, editor, and basic git for a Workspace.

Sometimes you want to look at what an agent changed, or fix something by
hand, without leaving Harmonic for a terminal. The **Files** view is a small
web IDE scoped to one Workspace, rooted at its Working Directory.

## The file tree

Open **Files** from the Workspace rail. The tree lists the repo from its
root, and colours each entry by git status — modified, added, untracked — so
you can see what has changed at a glance. Heavy directories like
`node_modules`, `.git`, and build output are seeded into a per-Workspace
exclude list and shown greyed rather than hidden; toggle any directory in or
out yourself.

One repo root per view — the active Workspace's Working Directory. Per-task
worktrees aren't folded in here; those stay in the Operations and diff
surfaces.

## Editing and saving

Click a file to open it in a tabbed editor. Text files edit in place and
save with `⌘S`; Markdown toggles between the source and a rendered preview.
Images and audio preview inline, and files past the edit cap (2 MB by
default) offer a download instead. Nothing is written until you save.

## Git, the basic parts

The source-control panel stages, unstages, discards, and commits changes,
with the same status colours as the tree. That's deliberately all of it —
no push, pull, merge, or branch. Those stay in your terminal; the Files view
is for reading and hand-fixing a working tree, not for driving shared
history.

## Live as it changes

A filesystem watcher keeps the tree and git status current as files change
on disk, whether you're editing them or an agent is.

## What it can reach

Every read and write is confined to the Workspace's Working Directory:
`..` traversal and symlink escape are rejected, the view is operator-only,
and every write is logged. It cannot touch files outside the workspace root.
