 * stalls there silently. Surface the bridge (press Run, or flip the auto-runner)
 * exactly while that's the operator's situation — never before a task is ready,
 * never once a run has been seen, never again after it's been dismissed.
 *
 * `tasks` is the board's open-only list, so a prior attempt that closed
 * (done/cancelled) can be off it entirely — `hasAttemptEvidence` still catches
 * it via the other fields. A returning operator whose every prior task has
 * aged off the open board entirely could still see this once; acceptable for
 * a dismissible, board-only hint.
