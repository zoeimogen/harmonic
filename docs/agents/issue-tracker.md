# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

## Epics

An **epic** is a parent issue whose children are the implementation tickets. Add the `epic` label when creating one (`gh issue create --label epic ...`) or immediately after (`gh issue edit <n> --add-label epic`). A root parent with children is also a structural Epic when the label is absent. Children are linked as GitHub sub-issues, with one-line `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` dependency edges in each child body.

Label epics even though an epic is also recognised structurally (a parent with children): the label declares intent, while a root parent is also demoted structurally. Both appear only as an Epic.

### Linking parents and blockers (native, UI-visible)

Sub-issue and blocked-by links are **native GitHub relationships**, not just body text — set them so the graph shows in the UI and gates the frontier live. Two ways:

- **At creation** (preferred when the parent/blockers already exist): `gh issue create` takes `--parent <n>` (link as a sub-issue of that parent), `--blocked-by <n,n>`, and `--blocking <n,n>`.
- **After the fact** (linking issues that already exist), via `gh api` with the target's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id` — _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`):
  - Sub-issue: `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<child-db-id>`
  - Blocked-by: `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`

Both routes write the same dependency; `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` (open blockers only) is the live gate. Still keep the one-line `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` in each child body as a human-readable fallback.

## Ownership and human reclaim

Harmonic decides whether it owns work from the local Task and Run state. Tracker
assignment is only a courtesy signal. Harmonic may add `@me`, but it never reads
the assignee to decide whether a ticket can run or whether Harmonic owns it.

To reclaim a queued ticket for a human, remove its `ready-for-agent` label before
taking it over. For a running ticket, remove the label and wait until its current
Run stops before taking over. Harmonic does not interrupt in-flight work during
a tracker poll. Assigning yourself while leaving the label in place does not
stop Harmonic from picking it. This intentionally differs from the upstream
skills convention where `assignee = claim`. Do not run the raw skills as a
second agent executor against tickets that remain labelled `ready-for-agent`.

Infer the repo from `git remote -v` — `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments` then keep only `authorAssociation` of `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or `NONE` (drop `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`).
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either — resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (`gh api` on the sub-issues endpoint). Where sub-issues aren't enabled, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies** — the canonical, UI-visible representation. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`, _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`). GitHub reports `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` (open blockers only — the live gate). Where dependencies aren't available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the child body. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children (`gh issue list --state open`, scoped to the map's sub-issues / task list), drop any with an open blocker (`issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by > 0`, or an open issue in the `Blocked by` line) or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me` — the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far.
