# Harmonic ADRs — the 2026-08-28 reset

On 2026-08-28 the accumulated 49-ADR trail was replaced by the **12 definitive
ADRs** in this directory. The old set had grown amendment chains, superseded
halves, and residue from an unapproved reliability design; the reset gives one
authoritative document per topic. The full pre-reset set — including its final
amendment notes and the review-audited reset plan (`ADR-RESET-PLAN.md`,
`ADR-RESET-REVIEW-LOG.md` at the repo root) — is preserved in git at annotated
tag **`adr-reset-2026-08-28`** (commit `1411730a8043`).

**Status banner — target state.** These ADRs describe the decided target
model. Until the ADR-0001 implementation epic ships, code, tables, and API
fields still carry pre-reset vocabulary (Run, phases, candidate refs, the
freshness gate); where they disagree, **the ADRs win**, and a code comment on
not-yet-torn-down machinery is marked `legacy until ADR-1 epic`.

## Where every pre-reset ADR went

One row per old ADR where it maps whole; clause rows where an ADR was partial
or split across destinations. "Dropped" decisions are gone by owner decision,
not omission. Old numbers below always refer to the **pre-reset** set (the
tag); new numbers are this directory.

| Old | Disposition |
|---|---|
| 0001 ACP-only | → new 0005, whole |
| 0002 accept-merges-branch | dead (review gate deleted); its merge-on-success intent restated in new 0001 |
| 0003 npx-from-GitHub | superseded → new 0012 (npm package, owner decision) |
| 0004 drop config repo | → new 0007 + 0009 (DB sole home of config) |
| 0005 OpenAPI from zod | → new 0011, whole |
| 0006 Conversations first-class | → new 0006, whole |
| 0007 interactive permissions | → new 0006, whole |

| 0009 usage from native logs | split: collection mechanism → new 0005; parsing/metric semantics → new 0008 |
| 0010 live persisted usage | → new 0008 (kept as-is); its "Cost never stored" clause superseded by 0035 |
| 0011 closure-as-success | dead (superseded pre-reset by 0021/0041); "closure is an output" → new 0004 |
| 0012 per-workspace overrides | split: resolution model, cap, master switch, chat defaults → new 0009; three-scope split superseded by 0044 → new 0009 |
| 0013 Starlight docs site | → new 0012, whole |
| 0014 tracker config workspace-only | → new 0004 (backfill shim noted removable) |
| 0015 graph view elkjs+SVG | → new 0011, whole |
| 0016 migrations FK-off | → new 0007 (reworded for libsql) |
| 0017 resolved tracker in-memory | → new 0004 (tension with 0030 recorded as settled) |
| 0018 steer a running task | → new 0005, whole (seven clauses enumerated) |
| 0019 guardrails trip to escalation | split: core → new 0002; v5-reconciliation section dropped (execution chains, phase-scoped budgets) |
| 0020 Sessions first-class | split: core (entity, `session/load`, warmth-as-cost, compatibility matrix, MCP templates, replay quarantine) → new 0005; keepalive, reattach, hardcoded window, reliability-design refs dropped |
| 0021 verification gate | split: core + tool-enabled-critic amendment → new 0003 (re-based: in-place, instruction-restrained, both revisions); v5 frozen-candidate pipeline dropped; merge-cleanliness amendment dropped (owner decision) |
| 0022 one run per work context | split: original scheduler predicate → new 0001; durable-lease reconciliation dropped |
| 0023 Harmonic owns branching | split: contract + detection + guardrail → new 0002; v5 reconciliation and clean-lease amendment dropped with the old integration path |
| 0024 epic integration + merge train | split: integration branch, `baseBranch`, whole-Epic gate, Epic derivation → new 0001 + 0004; merge train dropped; containment amendment reduced to the ancestor check (new 0001) + bounded-loop principle (new 0007) |
| 0025 hard-delete / dismiss | → new 0004 (four guarantees spelled out; cascade re-based to post-reset schema) |
| 0026 parallel-epic UI | split: board-hosted model + derived read endpoint → new 0011; Epic Peek, merge-train hero, force-merge rail replaced by the owner-designed Epic presentation (new 0011) |
| 0027 escalation escape hatches | dead (superseded pre-reset by 0041); the three-action surface → new 0002 |
| 0028 stats metric definitions | → new 0008, re-based to Attempt grain (duration = agent time only; rejection is a failed Attempt — owner decisions) |
| 0029 async libsql single-writer | split: driver, queue, atomicity, timeouts, monitor, yield rule → new 0007; "async ⇒ off-loop" claim struck (0036); lease-sweep examples dead |
| 0030 local DB source of truth | split: derivation, eligibility, claim, scheduling, priority, status, skip reasons, reclaim → new 0004; persistence principle → new 0007 |
| 0031 tool aggregates, JSONL on demand | → new 0007, whole |
| 0032 held permissions for autonomous runs | dropped (never built; owner decision) — noted in new 0006 |
| 0033 running-amber sub-AA exception | → new 0011, whole |
| 0034 migrate web app to Paper | split: Paper commitment, contrast gate, merged/merging vocabulary → new 0011; the eight-child migration sequence is spent, dropped |
| 0035 cost computed once and stored | → new 0008, whole |
| 0036 libsql inline; heavy reads off-thread | → new 0007, whole |
| 0037 Operations as OTel spans | → new 0010, whole (span names re-vocabularied; exhaustive-logging doctrine strengthened, owner decision) |
| 0038 Scheduled Jobs | split: Scheduler, registry, read surface → new 0010; job roster rewritten (lease + review-SLA sweeps retired with named dispositions) |
| 0039 oxlint | → new 0012, whole |
| 0040 critic transcript locator | → new 0003, whole |
| 0041 unified ticket lifecycle | split: vocabulary, states, Attempt loop, continuation rule, tracker-as-output, config keys, board/ticket visibility → new 0001/0004/0005/0011; escalation surface → new 0002; freshness gate, SHA-asserted merging, Rebase Task, merge-train reliance dropped |
| 0042 verification visible + timeline | split: Decisions A (verifier statuses incl. `planned`) and C (subagent attribution) → new 0003; Decision B (lifecycle timeline) → new 0011 (source list re-based) |
| 0043 operator-accept auto-rebase | dead — no path re-verifies on base movement; Accept runs the one merge policy (new 0001) |
| 0044 unified settings schema | split: schema, three-state inheritance, decomposition, list-grain commands, reclassification, one engine → new 0009; Decision F (validate resolved, loud unrunnable) → new 0003 + 0009 |
| 0045 lean paginated lists | → new 0011, whole |
| 0046 deterministic base-branch integration | superseded by the one merge policy; surviving parts (direct-in-place, per-Task worktree, quiet epic refresh, no forensic guards, merge/integrate vocabulary) → new 0001 |
| 0047 Run and Attempt coexist | dead — Run collapses into Attempt (new 0001), the narrowing 0047 itself anticipated |
| 0048 reject requeues | → new 0002, whole, including the warm-Session "start now" override and its rationale |
| 0049 execution model, one merge policy | renumbered → new 0001, with the scope clarification (per-Workspace-repository mutex, Task/Ticket ownership, Step, warm-Session exception deferring to new 0002) |

## Conventions

New ADRs are numbered sequentially from 0013. Format per the repo's ADR
template (Title, Status, Date, Context, Decision, Consequences, Supersedes).
The banned merge synonym from the pre-reset vocabulary purge stays banned in
all new decision text.
