# Decision: The execution model — verify the branch, merge with a merge commit, verify the base after

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-08-28
Part of the 2026-08-28 ADR reset (see README.md). Target-state: until the
implementation epic for this ADR ships, code, tables, and API fields still carry
pre-reset vocabulary (Run, phases, candidate refs) — this ADR wins.

## Context

Worktree parallelism was added over 2026-08-20 → 2026-08-28 and produced 148 fix
commits against 98 features, five defensive mechanisms built and demolished
within the week, four overlapping ledgers (~600 nominal state combinations), and
a 3,843-line `runner.ts`. A three-way review (architecture, commit forensics,
ADR drift) traced the churn to one invariant introduced by
`docs/reliability-design.md` and hardened by the pre-reset ADRs 0041/0046:

> verification must have seen exactly the tree that gets merged
> (frozen candidate OID, SHA-asserted fast-forward, expected-old-OID CAS).

In a system whose purpose is several parallel tasks merging into one base, that
guarantee makes each task's verification cost a function of how often its
*siblings* merge: every merge invalidates every other in-flight candidate,
forcing rebase + full re-verify — quadratic contention that the freshness gate,
the CAS retry loop, the merge train's stale/resubmit protocol, the carry-forward
verdict, and most of the escalation surface existed to manage. The system also
ran three different policies for the same operation (epic refresh: plain merge
commit, never re-verify; operator Accept: rebase, never re-verify; automated
path: full loop) — a policy inconsistency, not a safety property.

`docs/reliability-design.md` was never approved: its adversarial review log
records five rounds, all `VERDICT: REVISE`, shipped on `MAX_ROUNDS reached`.
Its machinery presumes concurrent uncoordinated writers; Harmonic is one Node
process, one SQLite file, one operator's machine. It is demoted to a risk
register: its failure-mode inventory stays useful; its mechanisms are void
where they conflict with this ADR.

This ADR is the definitive statement of the execution model.

## Scope and design ceiling

Harmonic runs as **one Node process against local repositories for one
operator** — many Workspaces, each its own repository (ADR-0009). Anything
justified only by concurrent uncoordinated writers — durable leases,
heartbeats, TTLs, compare-and-swap refs, crash-journaled merge operations,
idempotency keys — is out of scope by decision, not omission. Crash recovery
may rely on git's own idempotence and on rebuilding in-memory state from the DB
at boot.

## Vocabulary

- **Task** (synonym: **Ticket** — one concept, the board unit; "Ticket" is its
  tracker-facing flavour). The Task owns its branch and worktree.
- **Attempt** — one iteration of a Task's implement→verify loop, and the single
  execution noun: it carries the session, usage, guardrail scoping, transcript
  locator, and its timeline. Run, Phase, Candidate, and Self-heal are deleted
  concepts.
- **Step** — one row of an Attempt's timeline: Implementation Step, one
  Verification Step per configured command (ordered, fail-fast), Review Step.
- Task states: `draft → ready → working → done`, plus `escalated` and
  `cancelled` (and `paused`, an operator execution freeze added by ADR-0027).
  Blocked-ness and agent-workability are **derived**, never stored. There is no *failed* state (failure is an Attempt-level fact; a Task
  loops or escalates, and only a human closes it) and no *awaiting-review*
  (everything Harmonic runs is autonomous; human-only tickets are visible but
  not agent-workable).

## Decision

### The loop

1. **Tracker sync** mirrors issues, dependencies, and the `ready-for-agent`
   label (ADR-0004). A Task is *ready* when its blockers are closed and it is
   agent-workable.
2. **Scheduler** picks ready Tasks in dependency order, up to the configured
   concurrency caps (Workspace cap under the Machine Ceiling, ADR-0009). At
   most one active execution per work context (working directory + branch),
   enforced as a **scheduler pick predicate** — the pre-reset lease machinery
   (`work_context_leases`, heartbeats, TTLs, `suspect`) is deleted.
3. **One worktree per Task**, created at task start on a stable
   `harmonic/task-<id>` branch cut from the resolved base (develop, or
   `epic/<ref>` for an Epic member), reused by every Attempt, removed only at a
   terminal disposition.
4. **The Attempt loop**: the agent implements and **commits** (only the agent
   ever commits to the branch; a dirty worktree at implement-end gets a
   same-session nudge and does not increment the counter) → the deterministic
   verify commands run in order, fail-fast → the critic reviews against the
   ticket's acceptance criteria, given **both the base and candidate
   revisions** (ADR-0003). Any failure — command fail, review reject, or
   review `inconclusive` — is a **failed Attempt**: feedback flows into the
   next Attempt in the same worktree, counter +1;
   `attempts = maxAttempts → escalated`. The system never creates a new
   ticket.
5. **Merge** (below), then close out: mirror status to the tracker, remove the
   worktree, retire the Session.

Session continuation at Attempt N+1 is deterministic (ADR-0005): continue the
prior Session iff its context usage is below `contextReuseThreshold` and it is
warm; otherwise a fresh Session seeded by the condensed continuation plus the
feedback. The repo is the diff — no diff payload is passed.

### One merge policy, everywhere

When the critic passes, the task branch merges into its base under a single
**in-process mutex per Workspace repository** (a variable, not a table):

1. Acquire the mutex for the target base branch's repository.
2. `git merge --no-ff <task-branch>` — an ordinary merge commit. The merge
   commit reconciles the trees; base movement since verification is irrelevant
   and is never detected, classified, or alarmed.
3. On textual conflict: a bounded number of agentic resolve turns
   (`merge.conflictResolveTurns`), then escalate with plain-language messaging,
   never a raw git conflict dump.
4. **Post-merge check**: run the deterministic verify commands once on the
   merged base tip, still under the mutex.
   - Green → done. Release the mutex.
   - Red → `git revert -m 1` the merge commit, release the mutex, escalate the
     task with the failing output. The base is never left red, and siblings
     never merge onto a red base.

This one policy applies to **every** path: automated task merges, operator
Accept (which runs this same merge — no special rebase mode; on an escalated
candidate that was never blessed by a passing verifier it re-verifies against a
refreshed index first, ADR-0002, and Force-Accept skips that re-verify),
develop → epic refreshes, and epic → develop integration. There is no freshness
gate, no re-verification on base movement, no CAS, no retry bound, no merge
train, and no carry-forward verdict, because nothing needs carrying.

**Why this is safe enough**: the branch was verified by the script and reviewed
by the critic; the post-merge check catches semantic collisions between
concurrently merged work on the actual merged tree — which is *more* than the
frozen-tree model checked, since it verifies what the base really becomes; and
`git revert` of a merge commit costs seconds. Pre-merge serialisability bought
nothing that the post-merge check does not, at quadratic cost.

**Verification verdicts attach to the Attempt, not to a SHA.** A verdict is
never invalidated by movement elsewhere in the repository.

### Epics

- A per-Epic integration branch `epic/<ref>` is cut from develop; worktree-mode
  members fork off it (per-Task `baseBranch`) and merge into it by the policy
  above. Direct-mode members commit in place like any direct Task, and an Epic
  whose members are all direct has no integration branch: it completes in
  place when every member is done (ADR-0039). The
  Epic is derived from the tracker's parent/child structure (ADR-0004);
  Harmonic authors no Epic structure and stores no grouping entity.
- Develop is merged into live epic branches on advance, quietly; a refresh that
  cannot complete is recorded and retried on the next trigger, never raised as
  an operator hold. (A cheap ancestor check before integration keeps the
  operation idempotent when the epic's work is already contained in the
  default branch.)
- When all members are done, whole-Epic verify runs on the integration branch,
  then the epic merges into develop by the same policy (merge commit,
  post-merge check, revert on red). The branch then retires and is deleted.
- Partial failure blocks the whole Epic: an escalated member holds the epic's
  integration until an operator acts.

### Isolation modes

Two declared modes, stored on the Task — never inferred from branch shape or
any other data:

- **worktree** (the parallel mode): as above.
- **direct**: the agent works in the live checkout and commits onto the base
  branch in place; no isolation machinery, no candidate, no merge step. Its
  single checkout naturally serialises to one worker. A pre-existing dirty
  tree is tolerated and never fails the run. Accepted tradeoff: if
  verification fails and corrective turns are exhausted, the unverified
  commits remain on that checkout's branch — direct mode is explicitly the
  single-worker, operator-owns-the-checkout mode.

### Guardrails and escalation (kept — see ADR-0002)

- Attempt counter → cap → `escalated`; one escalation surface, three actions.
- Guardrail trips escalate.
- Requeues are rejected, never force-started — with the narrow warm-Session
  operator exception spelled out in ADR-0002 (`reject { start: true }`), whose
  wording takes precedence.
- New escalation triggers from this model: an unresolved merge conflict after
  the bounded turns, and a red post-merge check (with its revert recorded on
  the timeline).

### Forensic guards stay banned

**A moving base is normal, never a failure, and no runtime mechanism may try
to infer agent misbehaviour or staleness from ref movement** — the pre-reset
week proved such evidence cannot distinguish concurrency from bugs. The
branch-contract escalation (agent worked outside its worktree) remains,
detected from the agent's own working directory, not from watching refs
(ADR-0002).

## Consequences

- Deleted outright: the freshness gate and rebase re-entry, carry-forward
  verdicts, expected-old-OID CAS merge and `integrationRetries`, the merge
  train coordinator and its stale/resubmit protocol, the merge journal /
  point-of-no-cancellation machinery, `work_context_leases` (back to a
  scheduler predicate), Run phases and candidate capture, epic-refresh
  operator holds, and branch-sniffing isolation checks. Estimated ~9–11k LOC
  plus the dedicated test files.
- Schema migration: `runs` folds into `attempts`; historical Run rows are
  re-keyed as Attempts (read-only history preserved). This is the riskiest
  step of the implementation epic and goes last, after the code that read
  those tables is gone.
- Accepted cost: the merge mutex is held through the post-merge check, so
  merges serialise for the duration of the verify commands. Merges are rare
  relative to task duration; a slow suite can set `merge.postMergeCheck: off`
  (the branch was already script- and critic-verified) and rely on the next
  task's pre-merge verification to surface breakage.
- Accepted risk: between a merge and a red post-merge revert, the base briefly
  contains the broken merge. Nothing else can merge meanwhile (mutex), and the
  revert is automatic.
- History is no longer linear: bases gain merge commits. This is the trade
  that dissolves the contention loop.
- Process rule, recorded so it outlives the week: an adversarial plan review
  that ends `MAX_ROUNDS reached` is a **rejection**, and every review round
  must price failure modes against the deployment reality (one process, one
  laptop, revert costs seconds), with "remove mechanism" as an accepted
  resolution.

## Absorbed at the reset

Pre-reset 0049 (this document's prior form); 0041's vocabulary, states,
Attempt loop, continuation rule; 0022's original scheduler predicate; 0046's

no forensic guards, merge/integrate vocabulary); 0024's integration branch and
whole-Epic gate; 0002's merge-on-success intent. See README.md for the full
